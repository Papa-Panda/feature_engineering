"""
This module contains common python implementaions of applying categorical features for Machine Learning. 
Techniques are summarized in https://www.slideshare.net/HJvanVeen/feature-engineering-72376750. 

:class:`categoricalFeatureEngineering` is the fundamental class for turning categorical features into numerical features.
